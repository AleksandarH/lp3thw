Study Drills
1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.
2. Fix all of your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.
3. Write comments for the functions you do not understand.
4. Add more to the game. What can you do to both simplify and expand it?
5. The gold_room has a weird way of getting you to type a number. What are all the bugs in this
   way of doing it? Can you make it better than what I’ve written? Look at how int() works for clues.

Common Student Questions

Help! How does this program work?!
When you get stuck understanding a piece of code, simply
write an English comment above every line explaining what that line does. Keep your comments
short and similar to the code. Then either diagram how the code works or write a paragraph
describing it. If you do that you’ll get it.
Why did you write while True?
What does exit(0) do?

That makes an infinite loop.

On many operating systems a program can abort with exit(0), and
the number passed in will indicate an error or not. If you do exit(1) then it will be an error,
but exit(0) will be a good exit. The reason it’s backward from normal Boolean logic (with
0==False) is that you can use different numbers to indicate different error results. You can do
exit(100) for a different error result than exit(2) or exit(1).
Why is input() sometimes written as input('> ')?
The parameter to input is a string that it
should print as a prompt before getting the user’s input.

Done.
