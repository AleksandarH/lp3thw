Homework

Write a game similar to the one that I created in the last exercise. It can beany kind of game you want in the same flavor.

Spend a week on it making it as interesting as possible. For Study Drills use ists functions and modules (remember those form ex13.py) as much as possible, and find many new pieces of Python as you can to make the game work.

Before you coding you must draw a map for your game. Create the rooms, monsters, and traps that the player must go through on paper before you code.
Once you have your map, try to code it up. If you find problems with the map then adjust it and make the code match.

The best way to work on a piece of software is in small chunks like this

  1. On a sheet of paper or an index card write a list f dass you need to complete to finish the software  this is your to-do list.append

  2. Pick the easiest thing you can do from your list.

  3.  Write on English comments in your source file as a guide for you would accomplish this task in your code.

  4. Write some of the code under the English comments.

  5. Quicly run your script so see if thet code worked.

  6. Keep working in a cucle of writing some, running it to test it, and finxing it unitl it works.

  7. Cross this taks off your list, then pick your nexeasisest task and repeat.

This process will help you work on software in a methodical nand consistent manner. As you work, update your list by removing tasks you don't really need and adding ones you do.
